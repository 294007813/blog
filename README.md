# my blog introdution

My blog was founded in March 2012. used a PHP framework CMS, after more than a year of adjustment,I got an idea to use another architecture. In June 2013, I developed and launched node.Js version.
A first-time to coding node.Js, the code will certainly have a lot to modify place, welcome put forward amendments.
